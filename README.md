General Information
===================

This directory contains the tutorials of [code_saturne](https://code-saturne.org)
CFD tool, EDF's general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software.

## Getting started

Presentation
============

These tutorials will help you to start with code_saturne with the simulation of:
- A simplified nuclear vessel:
  - See 01_Simple_Junction, 02_Full_Domain and 03_Stratified_Junction tutorials.
- A shear driven cavity flow:
  - See 00_Driven_Cavity tutorial.
- Advanced tee junction CFD simulation:
  - See 05_Mixing_tee and 12_T_junction tutorials.
- A simple thermal case:
  - See 07_Heated_Square_Cavity tutorial.

They will also show you of to set a code_saturne / SYRTHES coupling:
- See 04_Three_2D_Disks tutorial.

And how to model particle dispersion in a turbulent pipe flow:
- See 06_Lagrangian_Particles tutorial.
